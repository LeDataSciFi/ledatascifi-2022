    "\n",
    "### Opening Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "- Windows: Open Anaconda Prompt and type `jupyter lab` and hit enter\n",
    "- Mac: Open a terminal window and type `jupyter lab` and hit enter\n",
    "\n",
    "### The JLab interface\n",
    "\n",
    "The left sidebar has several menus (you can expand and collapse each by clicking on them)\n",
    "- **The file browser:** Navigating to my project folder\n",
    "- Kernels: A list of running code\n",
    "- Commands: Has a lot of actions, and short cuts are listed\n",
    "- Extensions: VERY useful to make JLab more powerful \n",
    "\n",
    "In the main work area \n",
    "- you arrange documents (notebooks, text files, etc.) and other activities (terminals, code consoles, etc.) **into panels** (up to 4 panels) \n",
    "- each panel can have many tabs open \n",
    "- JLab can display most image files and text/code files\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Find your **class notes folder** by navigating inside of the \"file browser\" (click on the folder icon on the left part of the screen)\n",
    "    - After you click into a folder, you can go back up by clicking on the parent folder's name in the file path\n",
    "3. Create a folder: right click in file explorer pane and select \"New Folder\"\n",
    "    - For our purposes, do this and name the new folder \"notes\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Creating a notebook file\n",
    "\n",
    "In the folder you want the new file to be in,\n",
    "- Hit the $+$ button in the upper left, then under \"Notebook\", click on \"Python 3\"\n",

    "\n",
    "### Editing notebook files\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Jupyter notebook uses a modal editing system.**_\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the effect of typing at the keyboard depends on which mode you are in. The two modes are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When you are typing inside a cell, you are in **Edit mode**\n",
    "    - I.e. you're typing markdown or python code\n",
    "    - You can tell you are in edit mode because there is a dark border around the cell and its contents are sharp\n",
    "    - Also, the bottom of the panel says \"Mode: Edit\"\n",
    "    - **Switch into edit mode by hitting `Enter` or double clicking in the cell.**\n",
    "2. **Command mode** means that keystrokes are interpreted by Jupyter as \"commands\" on the notebook itself \n",
    "    - Example of a command: inserting a new cell, or executing the code in a cell\n",
    "    - You can tell you are in command mode because the cell and its contents are fuzzy\n",
    "    - Also, the bottom of the panel says \"Mode: Command\"    \n",
    "    -  **Switch into command mode by hitting `ESC`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The modal behavior of the Jupyter notebook is a little tricky at first but very efficient when you get used to it.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**I have two suggestions to learn more.** First, old Jupyter (not \"Jupyter Lab\", just \"Jupyter\") has a great walk through of working with notebook files. To go through it, \n",
    "1. Under the help tab, click \"Launch Classic Notebook\"\n",
    "2. A new tab opened up. \n",
    "3. In the upper right area, click on \"New\", and select \"Python 3\".\n",
    "4. A new tab opened up with an untitled notebook file. \n",
    "5. Click \"help\" in the upper bar, and then \"User Interface tour\". \n",

    "- `%conda` - runs the \"conda\" package manager within IPython (Conda installs, runs and updates packages)\n",
    "- `%debug` - starts the debugging interface\n",
    "- `%load` - loads a python file\n",
    "- `%%file` will save the cell (and just that cell) to a python file\n",
    "- You can ask IPython for help on magics! E.g. `%timeit?`\n",
    "- IPython can list all magics `%lsmagic` and describe them all `%magic` (although just going to the [official documentation](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#) is probably better)\n",

    "> When a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member, or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it's less a matter of knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown answer. In data science it's the same: searchable web resources such as online documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you've found yourself searching before. ~~Being an effective practitioner of data science~~ Being efficient in many aspects of life these days is less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you don't know, whether through a web search engine or another means.\n",

    "> One of the most useful functions of IPython/Jupyter is to shorten the gap between the user and the type of documentation and search that will help them do their work effectively. While web searches still play a role in answering complicated questions, an amazing amount of information can be found through IPython alone.\n",
