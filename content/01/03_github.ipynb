    "\n",
    "_**Note: I use Windows and will be of less help for Mac users. The TA, however, uses Mac and will be more helpful when issues stem from OS differences. GitHub, in particular, might be finicky if you have outdated versions of Safari or any other browser.**_\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using [GitHub](https://github.com) a lot in this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All of your course-related work will go on GitHub.\n",
    "- Discussion / help / announcements will happen on GitHub. (Yes, announcements!)\n",
    "- This entire textbook is on GitHub!\n",
    "- Assignments are \"posted\" and \"submitted\" on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why GitHub? Because it's tremendously effective for developing projects. It is used by [Apple](https://github.com/apple), [Uber](https://github.com/uber), [Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix), Google, Microsoft, Bitcoin, CERN, Chinese censors (wait, what?), and many more large, sophisticated, multi-billion dollar entities.\n",

    "## GitHub as cloud storage\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very least, GitHub allows for cloud storage, like Google Drive and Dropbox do. There's a bit more structure than just storing files under your account:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Repositories (aka \"repo\")__: All files must be organized into _repositories_. A repo is just a folder for a **self-contained** project. Repos can either be _public_ (like [this textbook](https://github.com/LeDataSciFi/ledatascifi-2022/)) or _private_ (like your assignments).\n",
    "- All repositories belong to a __user account__ or an __organization account (aka \"org\")__: \n",
    "    - A _user account_ is the account you just made, and typically holds repositories related to your own work. [Here is mine.](https://github.com/donbowen/)\n",
    "    - An _organization_ account can be owned by multiple people, and typically holds repositories relevant to a group. The [LeDataSciFi organization](https://github.com/LeDataSciFi/) account is owned by me, and contains the textbook and all of our assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The [`awesome-python`](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) repo is a \"curated list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources\" \n",
    "- The [`ledatascifi-2022`](https://github.com/LeDataSciFi/ledatascifi-2022) repo, within its corresponding `LeDataSciFi` Org contains this textbook. \n"

    "\n",
    "GitHub (not just \"Git\") is built on top of the Git system. Among the many added features that make collaboration easier, two are worth highlighting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The GitHub repository is treated as the \"master version\".\n",
    "    - You and collaborators work on the files on your computer and sync them to the cloud to update the master version.\n",
    "    - Use the [GitHub Workflow](#github-for-version-control) to make sure you and your collaborators don't make conflicting changes to a file. \n",
    "2. [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) make it easier to track project tasks than using email.    \n",
    "    - Each repo has an _Issues_ tab that functions as a discussion board.\n",
    "    - One \"thread\" is called an Issue. \n",
    "    - You can tag other GitHub users by typing `@username`. E.g. using `@donbowen`.  \n",
    "    - You get email notifications if you are tagged, or are `Watch`ing a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, check out the Issues in the [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues) repository. People raise issues of all kinds, and then when they are solved, \"Close\" the issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "When you have a question about your grades or a private question about an assignment, you can open that repo, click on the \"Issues\" tab, and create a new issue. Make sure to tag me and the TA in the text so we see your post.\n",
    "```\n",
