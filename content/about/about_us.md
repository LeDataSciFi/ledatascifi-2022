Somehow, I am still a Lions fan, even though stints in AZ, CA, PA, NY, TX, and FL has given me many chances to abandon ship!   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I took this class last semester and highly recommend. It's helped me tons with finding a job. Outside of school I like to do yoga, hike, and generally just be outside!

### Drop-in Hours are on [coursesite](https://coursesite.lehigh.edu/course/view.php?id=193947)

Aka "Office Hours". 

```{note}  
**I suspect that the initial learning curve will be steep, so we have posted a lot of office hours. Around Valentines Day, we will reduce our explicit office hours. Remember, when you get stuck, _especially_ on installation and set up issues,**
- post a question in our [classmates team](https://github.com/orgs/LeDataSciFi/teams/classmates)
- check out the resources in the [Resources and Help tab](resources).**

**Office hour schedules are subject to change, so please check back!**
