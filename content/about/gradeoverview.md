## Grading

```{warning}
Another time, for the people in the back:
- **Unless explicitly noted, all assignments must be completed individually.** 
- Changes to submissions after the deadline **will be ignored.**
- Missed assignments will receive a zero.

```{epigraph}
Just tell me about grades already.

-- You, probably

```{epigraph}
Ok, fine... Here is the high level overview of grades.

```{tabbed}  Participation (20%)
From most important to slightly less important:
- Discussion board replies: answering questions and/or moving conversations forward, being helpful and polite
- Discussion board posts: asking questions-but don't spam the board with low effort posts, sharing fun and related articles or code snippets ("Look what I found! Maybe this is useful")[^sharecode]
- Presenting pre-class exercise attempts (good faith attempts)
- In-class coding (mostly effort based)
- Contributions to discussions and poll/quiz answers
- Is your camera on when I randomly take snapshots of the gallery? 
```

[^sharecode]: Obviously, don't share code used on assignments

```{tabbed} Assignments (40%)
A few notes:
- Later assignments will receive larger grade components
- Each assignment grade will come from an average of two peer reviews (adjusted for objective errors in reviews and large subjective ones)
- Unless explicitly noted, all assignments must be completed individually. 
```

```{tabbed}  Peer review (20%)
You should aspire to 
- Write accurate and honest reviews
- Actually run the code to verify accuracy
- Give helpful, constructive, and nice feedback
```

```{tabbed}  Final Project (20%)
It's going to be fun!

```
