    "    - [Fill out this survey so we know your username and get to know you](https://forms.gle/425BySmg2TxFMoid6).  \n",
    "    - Join the class's GitHub organization by joining the \"gradebook\" repo. The link for that is in [coursesite](https://coursesite.lehigh.edu/course/view.php?id=193947), and it is \"classroom.github.com/\\<other stuff\\>\".\n",
    "    - Please add a profile photo on GitHub, to make our exchanges and community more personal (it's easier for classmates to ignore a \"Twitter egg\" than a smiling Mountain Hawk)\n",

    "    ```{tip}\n",
    "    Once Jupyter Lab is open, it often helps to open a **second** powershell window. This will let you run terminal commands, which you can't do in the first powershell window (because that one is running jupyter lab).\n",

    "    - **Mac users**: Your TA installed Git via Homebrew. Go to [https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh), copy the home-brew address (they have a little copy paste icon which makes it easier for students), then type `brew install git` into the terminal and it'll install git. (There is no config necessary, type \"y \" when prompted with `y/n?`)\n",
