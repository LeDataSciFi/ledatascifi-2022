    "## Why Github? \n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note: I use Windows and will be of less help for Mac users. The TA, however, uses Mac and will be more helpful when issues stem from OS differences. GitHub, in particular, might be finicky if you have outdated versions of Safari or any other browser.**_\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using [GitHub](https://github.com) a lot in this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All of your course-related work will go on GitHub.\n",
    "- Discussion / help / announcements will happen on GitHub. (Yes, announcements!)\n",
    "- This entire website is on GitHub!\n",
    "- Assignments are posted on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why GitHub? Because it's tremendously effective for developing a project. It is used by [Apple](https://github.com/apple), [Uber](https://github.com/uber), [Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix), Google, Microsoft, Bitcoin, CERN, Chinese censors (wait, what?), and many more large, sophisticated, multi-billion dollar entities.\n",

    "It's useful for (1) cloud storage, (2) collaboration, and (3) version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub as cloud storage\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very least, GitHub allows for cloud storage, like Google Drive and Dropbox do. There's a bit more structure than just storing files under your account:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Repositories (aka \"repo\")__: All files must be organized into _repositories_. Think of these as folders with **self-contained** projects. These can either be _public_ or _private_.\n",
    "- __User Accounts__ vs. __Organization Accounts (aka \"Org\")__: All repositories belong to an account:\n",
    "    - A _user account_ is the account you just made, and typically holds repositories related to your own work. \n",
    "    - An _Organization_ account can be owned by multiple people, and typically holds repositories relevant to a group (like STAT 545).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The [`awesome-python`](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) repo is a \"curated list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources\" \n",
    "- The [`ledatascifi-2021 `](https://github.com/LeDataSciFi/ledatascifi-2021) repo, within its corresponding `LeDataSciFi` Org contains these lectures. \n"

    "### Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of lecture one and before the next class, you should be able to and have completed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a participation repo called \"Class Notes\" (with a blank README<span>.</span>md file). The repo on GitHub.com is called the \"main\" or \"master\" or \"origin\" repo. \n",
    "2. \"Clone\" that to your computer. The folder and files on your computer are called the \"remote\" repo. \n",
    "3. Modify the repo **in the cloud** and, then, \"fetch\" those changes to your computer. Think of \"fetch\" as syncing your computer to catch up with any changes in the master.\n",
    "4. Modify the repo **on your computer**, and then, \"push\" those changes to the cloud. Think of \"push\" as syncing the master to catch up with any changes from your computer.\n",

    "\n",
    "Git (just \"Git\") is a distributed version control system. Basically: \"Imagine if Dropbox and the \"Track changes\" feature in MS Word had a baby. Git would be that baby.\" It's great for us because it's optimized for code. \n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub (not just \"Git\") is built on top of the Git system. Among the many added features that make collaboration easier, two are worth highlighting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The GitHub repository is treated as the \"master version\".\n",
    "- **You can (and probably should!) use [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) instead of email to track open tasks.** \n",
    "    - _Issues_ are a discussion board corresponding to a particular repository. \n",
    "    - One \"thread\" is called an Issue. Some features:\n",
    "    - You can tag other GitHub users using `@username`. \n",
    "    - Get email notifications if you are tagged, or are `Watch`ing a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, check out the Issues in the [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues) repository. People raise issues of all kinds, and then when they are solved, \"Close\" the issue. You can \n",
