print(2//3, type(2//3)) # floor division returns an integer. 
# FOR YOU to try: use this to tell me how many full hours are in 7643 minutes?


print(2%3) # mod operator
print(2*3) # multiplication
print(2**3) # 2 to the power of three
print(2^3) # ^ is NOT the power operator!!! it is a 'bit' operator - you don't need to know this for now

                  # 3. this should be a float (21.0), but you can convert a float to an int with the int() function
