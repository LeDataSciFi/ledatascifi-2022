print(df)  # see, the object has no feet! this is the original obj!


# option 1: explicitly define the df as the prior df after the method was called
# here, that means to add "df = " before the df.method 
df = df.assign(feet1=df['height']//12) 

# option 2: define a new feature of the df
# here, "df['newcolumnname'] = " (some operation)
df['feet2']=df['height']//12

print(df) # both of these added to obj in memory
